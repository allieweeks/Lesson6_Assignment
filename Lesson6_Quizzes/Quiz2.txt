Questions:

1.  Name two methods you can use to add a node to the DOM tree, and explain the difference between them.
parentNode.appendChild(childNode) is the most basic way to attach node to a DOM tree. You declare the node that you want to attach, which is the child node, and the node to attach it to, which is the parent node.
Another way is to create the text node by using the createTextNode() method of the document object. document.createTextNode(Text) returns a node with the text in it.
